Test library for linear motion with libfranka:
    ✔ `Trajectory generation` for simple linear case
    ✔ `MotionProfile Generation` with polynomial approach
    ✔ `homogeneousTfArray2PoseVec` und `poseVec2HomogeneousTfArray` in `Trajectory.h`
    ✔ Testing
    ✔ Class with () operator to acoid calling lambda functions on `robot.control()` @done(19-07-04 17:27)
    ✔  Doxygen documentation @done(19-07-04 17:27)
    ✔ Adjust angle conversion betwwen Euler representation and quaternion representation (Franka)
    ☐ Add Logging (instead of console output). Or Program option `--verbose`
    ☐ Handle dynamic timesteps? Summing up Duration yields numerical errors after a large number of steps.
    ☐ Properly treat quaternions analytically
